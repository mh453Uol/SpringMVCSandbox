	<h1>Spring MVC</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion
		of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core
		features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions
		for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise
		Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific
		programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an
		addition to, or even replacement for the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
		model. The Spring Framework is open source.</p>
	<h1>Modules</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The Spring Framework includes several modules that provide a
		range of services: Spring Core Container: this is the base module of
		Spring and provides spring containers (BeanFactory and
		ApplicationContext).[11] Aspect-oriented programming: enables
		implementing cross-cutting concerns. Authentication and authorization:
		configurable security processes that support a range of standards,
		protocols, tools and practices via the Spring Security sub-project
		(formerly Acegi Security System for Spring). Convention over
		configuration: a rapid application development solution for
		Spring-based enterprise applications is offered in the Spring Roo
		module Data access: working with relational database management
		systems on the Java platform using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
		and object-relational mapping tools and with NoSQL databases Inversion
		of control container: configuration of application components and
		lifecycle management of Java objects, done mainly via dependency
		injection Messaging: configurative registration of message listener
		objects for transparent message-consumption from message queues via
		Java Message Service (JMS), improvement of message sending over
		standard JMS APIs Model–view–controller: an HTTP- and servlet-based
		framework providing hooks for extension and customization for web
		applications and RESTful (representational state transfer) Web
		services. Remote access framework: configurative remote procedure call
		(RPC)-style marshalling of Java objects over networks supporting Java
		remote method invocation (RMI), CORBA (Common Object Request Broker
		Architecture) and HTTP-based protocols including Web services (SOAP
		(Simple Object Access Protocol)) Transaction management: unifies
		several transaction management APIs and coordinates transactions for
		Java objects Remote management: configurative exposure and management
		of Java objects for local or remote configuration via Java Management
		Extensions (JMX) Testing: support classes for writing unit tests and
		integration tests</p>
